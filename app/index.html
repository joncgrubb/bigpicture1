<p>You gotta shove these seeds way up your butt Morty, waay up there. Awww, it's you guys! What are you looking at, mother fucker! The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.</p>

<p>Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad. I'm sorry, Morty, it's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back. So now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty. Because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important. And they'll tear us apart, Morty. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty. And you're gonna be part of them. And together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna- do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. 100 years, Rick and Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever a hundred times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. www.rickandmorty.com. www.rickandmortyadventures. All 100 years every minute, rickandmorty.com. www.100timesrickandmorty.com. God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me. Where are my testicles, Summer? </p>
